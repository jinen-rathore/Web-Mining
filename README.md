# Flight Network Analysis
The J-component project for Web Mining course 

## Asbtract
Flight network analysis is an important tool for understanding the complex and interconnected structure of the aviation industry. The main objective of this analysis is to better understand the relationship between airlines, airports and passengers, and to identify key trends and patterns in air traffic. Analytics typically involves the collection and analysis of large amounts of data about flight routes, passenger traffic, and other relevant parameters. This data can be obtained from a variety of sources, including flight records, passenger surveys, and public air traffic data.
Once the data is collected, various analytical techniques can be applied to identify trends and patterns in the flight network. For example, network visualization tools can be used to show the relationship between airports and airlines and to highlight key hubs and hubs. Another popular analytical technique is social media analysis, which can help identify the most important airlines and airports in terms of connectivity and passenger traffic.
In addition to identifying key trends and patterns, flight network analysis can also be used to optimize planning and routing.
